## Overview

This repository contains the program which i built in order to achieve the Udacity React Fundamentals course. This was my first introduction to React and completing this course was very engaging and allowed me to learn a lot. 

"Would You Rather" allows users create, answer and vote on would you rather questions. This project encourages the use of React's component-based architecture, state management, and lifecycle methods to create a responsive and interactive user interface. It emphasises the principles of code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Throughout this project I had the opportunity to practice key React.js concepts such as creating functional and class components, managing state and props, handling user interactions, and implementing routing for multiple app views.

Although this project is not complete, due to the time constraints, I believe that it is important to show were I was about to get to in this devleopment. Once i have gain move web development skills I would like to return to complete this.

I am a Junior Software developer working mainly with Mircosoft PowerPlatforms, this repository is part of a larger portfolio I am developing as part of my personal education whilst transtioning from low-code development.

## Skills Learned

As this project was part of the assements in the [Udacity React Fundaments](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) I learnt everything I currently know about React whilst completing this project. However through my studies I beleive the key aspects of react that I learnt were: 

- State Management: I learnt the importance of state management, how to use props to pass data into components, how to add state to components and how to use useState to update components state.
- UI + Redux: I learnt how to combine Redux with a user interface.
- Redux Middleware: I learnt the benefits of middleware with Redux Cycle, how to apply middleware to Redux application.
- Redux with React: I learnt how to identify when use component state vs Redux state and how to leverage React-Redux bindings to extend app functionality.
